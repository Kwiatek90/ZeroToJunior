#1. Write a script that grabs the full HTML from the page
#http://olympus.realpython.org/profiles
#2. Parse out a list of all the links on the page using Beautiful Soup by
#looking for HTML tags with the name a and retrieving the value
#taken on by the href attribute of each tag.
#3. Get the HTML from each of the pages in the list by adding the full
#path to the file name, and display the text (without HTML tags) on
#each page using Beautiful Soupâ€™s .get_text() method.
