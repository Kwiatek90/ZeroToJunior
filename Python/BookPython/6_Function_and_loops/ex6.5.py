#In this challenge, you will write a program called invest.py that tracks
#the growing amount of an investment over time.
#An initial deposit, called the principal amount, is made. Each year,
#the amount increases by a fixed percentage, called the annual rate of
#return.
#For example, a principal amount of $100 with an annual rate of return
#of 5% increases the first year by $5. The second year, the increase is
#5% of the new amount $105, which is $5.25.
#rite a function called invest with three parameters: the principal
#amount, the annual rate of return, and the number of years to calculate. The function signature might look something like this:
#def invest(amount, rate, years):
#The function then prints out the amount of the investment, rounded
#to 2 decimal places, at the end of each year for the specified number
#of years.
#For example, calling invest(100, .05, 4) should print the following:
#year 1: $105.00
#year 2: $110.25
#year 3: $115.76
#year 4: $121.55
#To finish the program, prompt the user to enter an initial amount, an
#annual percentage rate, and a number of years. Then call invest() to
#display the calculations for the values entered by the user.
