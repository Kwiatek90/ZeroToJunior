#Suppose you flip a fair coin repeatedly until it lands on both heads
#and tails at least once each. In other words, after the first flip, you
#continue to flip the coin until it lands on something different.
#Doing this generates a sequence of heads and tails. For example, the
#first time you do this experiment, the sequence might be heads, heads,
#then tails.
#On average, how many flips are needed for the sequence to contain
#both heads and tails?
#Write a simulation that runs 10,000 trials of the experiment and
#prints the average number of flips per trial
